	<h1> <center>Modelling Triplets/Quartets using Epistemic Logic </center></h1>
	<h2> Introduction</h2>

	<IMG SRC="giphy.gif"align="right">
	On this website you can find our project for Multi Agent Systems about modelling Quartets and the less complex version Triplets. 
	<p>	
	Quartets is a well known game in which sets of four cards have to be allocated. The game is usually played with decks of 32 cards which are divided into eight sets.<br>
	In this project, we modeled a simplified version of Quartets using epistemic logic, and look into the effect of actions on the epistemic model.
	</p>
	<h3> Rules of the Simplified Version </h3>
	<p>
	The goal of the project is to model the aforementioned game using epistemic model logic. We want to look at the effect on possible worlds when a player asks for a card, and what happens to the model depending on the reaction of the asked player. If this all goes well we hope to learn something about good strategies in Quartets so we can win more games when challenging our  friends and families at this game.<br>
Our models of Triplets and Quartets can be found by using the following links:
